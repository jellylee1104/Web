  <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
        <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
        <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
        <p>On our first day, we started by visting <em>Monmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower(Check out tha beautiful picture!) we ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine.</em></p>

        <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenus des Champs Elysees.</em> Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br><br>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!We went to <em>Notre Dame.</em>            We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had offer.

        <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe.</em> It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D’Orsay.</em> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtalking . I was surpised to see that museum also
            had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin , Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
